                <h2>Explain the concept of Responsive Design. What does the term mean?</h2>
                <p>The concept of responsive design refers to the way a website or application's design responds to its environment.</p>
                <h2>How does responsive design relate to web technologies?</h2>
                <p>Web pages were previously built for screen size. 
                    As more users began to browse websites using cellphones,<br/>
                    Contents of the web pages were inaccessible as it were too large for the screen.<br/>
                    Contents of the websites were not able to adapt to different display sizes.<br/>
                    Responsive design relate to web technologies through HTML and CSS.<br/>
                    Responsive web design ensure that regardless of the screen size, the web page must be<br/>
                    usable and visually appealing; this means users should be able to browse<br/>
                    on a web page using various devices such as laptop, tablet and smartphones.</p>
                <h2>What did you learn about building web apps for different devices through your research?</h2>
                    <p>Based on my research, I learned that I should always keep in mind that various devices will be used to access the web application.<br/>
                    I should always test to see if the web application is easy to use not just in desktop, but in other devices as well such as smartphone and tablet.<br/>
                    Furthermore, the web application should be readable regardless of the display siz; this means I should use proper font style, size, and colour for readability.</p>
                <h2>Describe your learning experience in the course</h2>
                <p>At first, I thought it was odd that the first thing that I was being taught was JavaScript. 
                    From what I remember and I have heard online and from my friends, the order of learning<br/>
                    the three web languages is HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I realized that web technologies evolve over the years and traditional methods change over time. 
                    I learned that it is best to understand JavaScript first because of the concept of DOM.<br/> 
                    I thought I was going to struggle with JavaScript but due to my previous experience with C language, JavaScript was slightly easy to understand.<br/>
                    My main struggle was remembering the syntax. I always try to write my own code in Visual Studio and apply what I have learned in the current lesson.<br/>
                    This was my way of preparing for the quiz. HTML was easy to learn because I had previous experience with it when I was in 6th grade.<br/>
                    CSS is the most fun to learn because it involves creativity. I can choose my own layout and colour.<br/>
                    In addition, I can add animation to my web page, which I never I thought I would be able to do.<br/>
                    My professor's vast knowledge and passion for web development encouraged me to learn and improve in web design.<br/>
                    I see my skill set as decent, but not good enough. Therefore, I want to work hard to improve my skills in web design and development.<br/>
                    After this course, I will continue to practice the three web languages because there were some parts that I had struggles understanding.<br/>
                    I will try to look into responsive web design because with my current skillset, I can only create web pages only suitable for desktop.</p>
